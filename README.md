## PID-Controller-Simulation


PID controller is a name commonly given to a three-term controller. P stands for the proportional term, I for the integral term, and D for the derivative term in the controller [1]. PID controllers are probably the most widely used industrial controller. Even complex industrial control systems may comprise a control network whose main control building block is a PID control module [1].  

In this repository, I will provide a MATLAB application (GUI) that can be used as an educational tool to understand, visualize, and test the concept of PID controllers in a real-life example.  The application is inspired by the system built in [2]. In this tool, the PID controller will attempt to balance a green ball on a red moving bar. The position of the ball is measured, and the slope of the bar is modified (increased or decreased) in order to balance the green ball at a position defined by the user. 

In the simulation provided here, the user can control:  
  1. the initial position of the ball   
  2. the initial slope of the bar	  
  3. the desired position at which the ball should stop	  
  4. the PID controllerâ€™s gains, namely, Kp, Ki, and Kd gains that correspond to P, I, and D terms, respectively
