# PID-Controller-Simulation


PID controller is a name commonly given to a three-term controller. P stands for the proportional term, I for the integral term, and D for the derivative term in the controller [1]. PID controllers are probably the most widely used industrial controller. Even complex industrial control systems may comprise a control network whose main control building block is a PID control module [1].  

This repository contains a MATLAB application (GUI) as well as Python code that can be used as an educational tool to understand, visualize, and test the concept of PID controllers in a real-life example.  The application is inspired by the system built in [2]. In this tool, the PID controller will attempt to balance a green ball on a red moving bar. The position of the ball is measured, and the slope of the bar is modified (increased or decreased) in order to balance the green ball at a position defined by the user. 

## Matlab
In Matlab the simulation provided here, the user can control:  
  1. the initial position of the ball   
  2. the initial slope of the bar	  
  3. the desired position at which the ball should stop	  
  4. the PID controllerâ€™s gains, namely, Kp, Ki, and Kd gains that correspond to P, I, and D terms, respectively  
	

## Python

As for the Python code, first install the 'controller' package using:
```
python -m pip install -e  ".\PID-Controller-Simulation\Python"
```
Once installed, use the following command line to learn how to use the package:
```
python controller -h
```
You will get:
```
usage: python -m controller [-h] [-t TYPE] [-e EXAMPLE] [--kp KP] [--ki KI] [--kd KD]
                            [--final-position FINAL_POSITION] [-i ITERATIONS]

An example code:
python -m controller -t "PID" -e "ball"

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  The controller type.
  -e EXAMPLE, --example EXAMPLE
                        The example on which the controller is tested.
  --kp KP               Gain of the `propotion` part of the PID controller.
  --ki KI               Gain of the `integration` part of the PID controller.
  --kd KD               Gain of the `derivative` part of the PID controller.
  --final-position FINAL_POSITION
                        Ball`s final position when using the `ball` example. Choose values between -3 and 3.
  -i ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Maximum number of iterations before program stops.
```

Therefore, to use a PID controller to balance a ball, you can use the following command line:
```
python -m controller -t "PID" -e "ball" --kp 0.1 --ki 0.1 --kd 0.4 --final-position 0 -i 100                                                                                                                        
```

If you want to run the Python GUI, use the following command line:
```
python \controller\GUI.py
```

The repository also contains a '.exe' file (PID.exe) that can run the simulator directly.
